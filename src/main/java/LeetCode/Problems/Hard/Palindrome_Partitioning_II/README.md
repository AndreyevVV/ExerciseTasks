Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every

of the partition is a .

Return _the **minimum** cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of_ `s`.


**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
