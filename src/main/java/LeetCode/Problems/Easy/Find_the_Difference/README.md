You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.


**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```


**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `t.length == s.length + 1`
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
