Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, _delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once_. Return _the linked list **sorted** as well_.

**Example 1:**

![img.png](img.png)

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
-   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
-   The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.
