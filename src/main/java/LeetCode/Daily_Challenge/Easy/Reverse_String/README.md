Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.


**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```


**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.
