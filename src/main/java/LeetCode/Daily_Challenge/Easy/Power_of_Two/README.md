Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if it is a power of two_. _Otherwise, return_ `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of two, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 2x`.


**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```


**Example 3:**

``` Java
Input: n = 3
Output: false
```


**Constraints:**

* `-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`
