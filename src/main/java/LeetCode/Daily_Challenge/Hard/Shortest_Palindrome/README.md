You are given a string `s`. You can convert `s` to a

palindrome

by adding characters in front of it.

Return _the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation_.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: "dcbabcd"
```


**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
-   `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
