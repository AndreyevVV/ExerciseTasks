Given two integers `n` and `k`, return _the_ `k^th` _lexicographically smallest integer in the range_ `[1, n]`.


**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: n = 13, k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
```


**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`
