You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements.

You are allowed to remove any **subsequence** of elements of size **exactly** `n` from `nums`. The remaining `2 * n` elements will be divided into two **equal** parts:

-   The first `n` elements belonging to the first part and their sum is `sum_first`.
-   The next `n` elements belonging to the second part and their sum is `sum_second`.

The **difference in sums** of the two parts is denoted as `sum_first - sum_second`.

-   For example, if `sum_first = 3` and `sum_second = 2`, their difference is `1`.
-   Similarly, if `sum_first = 2` and `sum_second = 3`, their difference is `-1`.

Return _the **minimum difference** possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of_ `n` _elements_.


**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.
```


**Constraints:**

-   `nums.length == 3 * n`
-   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
-   `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
