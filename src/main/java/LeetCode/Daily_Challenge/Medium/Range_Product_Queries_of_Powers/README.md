Given a positive integer `n`, there exists a **0-indexed** array called `powers`, composed of the **minimum** number of powers of `2` that sum to `n`. The array is sorted in **non-decreasing** order, and there is **only one** way to form the array.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]`. Each `queries[i]` represents a query where you have to find the product of all `powers[j]` with `left_i <= j <= right_i`.

Return *an array `answers`, equal in length to `queries`, where `answers[i]` is the answer to the `i^th` query*. Since the answer to the `i^th` query may be too large, each `answers[i]` should be returned **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Â 

**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: n = 15, queries = [[0,1],[2,2],[0,3]]
Output: [2,4,64]
Explanation:
For n = 15, powers = [1,2,4,8]. It can be shown that powers cannot be a smaller size.
Answer to 1st query: powers[0] * powers[1] = 1 * 2 = 2.
Answer to 2nd query: powers[2] = 4.
Answer to 3rd query: powers[0] * powers[1] * powers[2] * powers[3] = 1 * 2 * 4 * 8 = 64.
Each answer modulo 109 + 7 yields the same answer, so [2,4,64] is returned.
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0]]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
For n = 2, powers = [2].
The answer to the only query is powers[0] = 2. The answer modulo 109 + 7 is the same, so [2] is returned.
```


**Constraints:**

 * `1 <= n <= 10^9`
 * `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
 * `0 <= start_i <= end_i < powers.length`
