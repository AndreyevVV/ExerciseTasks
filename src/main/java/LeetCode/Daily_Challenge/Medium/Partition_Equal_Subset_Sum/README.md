Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` _if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or_ `false` _otherwise_.


**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```


**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
-   `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
