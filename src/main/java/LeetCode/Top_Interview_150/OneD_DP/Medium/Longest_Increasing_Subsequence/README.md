Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **strictly increasing**_ _**subsequence**_

**Example 1:**

```
Input nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output 4
Explanation The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output 1
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
-   `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?
