Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `t` _is an anagram of_ `s`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
-   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
