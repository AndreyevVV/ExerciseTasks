Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n<sup>th</sup>` node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**

![img.png](img.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
-   `1 <= sz <= 30`
-   `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
-   `1 <= n <= sz`

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?
